# Email Templates Library

## Overview
Battle-tested email templates organized by persona and messaging angle. All templates use the **"Who, Why, What"** framework:
- **Who you are** (brief, relevant intro)
- **Why it matters to them** (pain point or priority)
- **What you want** (assumptive meeting ask)

## Template Guidelines

✅ **Do:**
- Keep under 150 words
- Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Lead with prospect's pain/priority
- Use confident, assumptive language
- Include specific time options
- Personalize at least one element

❌ **Don't:**
- Use passive language ("I was hoping...")
- Lead with features
- Write dense blocks of text
- Include multiple asks
- Forget to customize {{placeholders}}

## Persona 1: Technical Leader (Head of AI / Engineering)

### Template A: Data Bottleneck Angle

**Subject:** Cutting model training time at {{company}}?

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I'm {{your_name}} at {{company}}. We work with {{industry}} teams on a common bottleneck: insufficient training data.

{{prospect_company}}'s models likely need massive datasets. Our platform generates synthetic training data on-demand—one client boosted accuracy by 22%.

I'm looking to set up 15 minutes next week to share how this could accelerate your projects. Does Wednesday at 10:00 or Thursday at 2:00 work?

Thanks,
{{your_name}}
```

**When to use:** Prospect is in data-intensive AI/ML role

### Template B: ROI & Efficiency Angle

**Subject:** {{company}} – higher accuracy, lower cost?

```
Hi {{first_name}},

{{Your_company}} helps {{industry}} teams achieve better results without 10x data costs.

We worked with {{similar_company}} to improve {{metric}} from X% to Y%—saving ~$300K in the process.

Let's set aside 20 minutes to discuss how this might work for {{prospect_company}}. Available {{date_1}} or {{date_2}}?

Regards,
{{your_name}}
{{phone}} | {{email}}
```

**When to use:** Prospect cares about cost efficiency or budget constraints

## Persona 2: Product/R&D Leader

### Template C: Timeline Acceleration

**Subject:** Shortening your project timeline

```
Hello {{first_name}},

Projects like {{company}}'s {{project}} live or die by timelines. {{Your_company}} helps teams reduce development time by {{method}}.

Teams we support cut cycles by ~30%.

I'd like to show how this might keep your timelines on track. Available this week on {{date_1}} or {{date_2}}?

Best,
{{your_name}}
```

**When to use:** Prospect is managing delivery timelines

## Follow-Up Templates

### Follow-Up #1 (Day 3)

```
Hi {{first_name}},

Just following up on my note below—are you open to discussing how we might help with {{pain_point}}?

Thanks!
{{your_name}}
```

### Follow-Up #2 (Day 5 - Ultra Short)

```
{{first_name}},

Please give me your thoughts on this.

{{your_name}}
```

### Follow-Up #3 (Day 7 - Breakup)

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I know inboxes are busy. Should I stay or should I go?

If this isn't relevant right now, no worries—just let me know and I won't follow up again.

If timing is just off, when should I circle back?

Thanks,
{{your_name}}
```
