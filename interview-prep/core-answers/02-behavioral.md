# Behavioral Questions (6-10)

## Q6: How Do You Handle Rejection?

### What They're Really Asking
- Will you last when "no" is the default response?
- Do you take rejection personally?
- Can you bounce back quickly?

### Your Answer Framework

**Structure:**
1. Acknowledge rejection is normal and expected
2. Explain how you detach and extract lessons
3. Connect to sales context
4. Have a story ready

### YOUR ANSWER:

```
[DRAFT YOUR ANSWER HERE]

"Rejection and failure is something I've faced a lot - whether in sports, school, or work. I don't view it as rejection. I view it as feedback.

Whenever I face it, I first detach myself. I don't take it personally. Instead, I ask: What lesson can I learn? How can I adjust and improve?

I view rejection as a necessary part of growth. You're never going to master something without making mistakes.

In sales, I know 'no' is the default answer. I view it like baseball - the best hitters bat .300. They walk back to the dugout 7 out of 10 times. But they don't stop swinging.

That's how I'll approach the SDR role. Take the feedback, apply it, use it to get better."
```

**Story Preparation (STAR Framework):**
- **Situation:** [What was the context?]
- **Task:** [What were you trying to achieve?]
- **Action:** [What did you do after rejection?]
- **Result:** [What was the outcome?]

```
YOUR STORY:
[Draft a specific example of handling rejection]

Example: Didn't make a sports team, got tough feedback, applied it, made the team next year.
```

## Q7: Tell Me About a Time You Overcame a Setback

### What They're Really Asking
- Can you stay calm when things go wrong?
- Do you take ownership or point fingers?
- Are you resilient?

### Your Answer Framework (STAR)

**Structure:**
1. **Situation** - Describe the setback
2. **Task** - What needed to be fixed
3. **Action** - Steps you took
4. **Result** - Outcome + lesson learned

### YOUR STORY:

```
[DRAFT YOUR ANSWER HERE USING STAR]

Example Structure:

**Situation:**
"I was trying out for the varsity soccer team as a sophomore. I trained all summer, got in great shape, really focused on making the team."

**Task/Setback:**
"During tryouts, I almost made it but got cut at the very end. The feedback was that my ball control wasn't where it needed to be."

**Action:**
"I had a choice: give up or apply the feedback. I spent that year on JV really focusing on footwork and ball control. I took it seriously in the offseason."

**Result:**
"I ended up making varsity as a junior with way better ball control than I would have had. I became a much better player because of that tough feedback.

That's how I approach setbacks - I don't take them personally. I use them as opportunities to get better. I know that's what it'll take in the SDR role too."
```

**Good Story Topics:**
- Sports team cuts / tryouts
- Group project that went sideways
- Work project that needed to start over
- Academic challenge you overcame

## Q8: Tell Me About a Time You Worked in a Team Setting

### What They're Really Asking
- Are you someone others want to work with?
- Do you bring value to teams or just blend in?
- Can you collaborate without taking over?

### Your Answer Framework (STAR)

**Key Points to Hit:**
- Show you bring value to teams
- Demonstrate you can handle disagreements
- Emphasize collaboration over ego

### YOUR STORY:

```
[DRAFT YOUR ANSWER HERE]

Example Structure:

**Your Approach to Teams:**
"Anytime I work in a team, my first mindset is: How can I bring value? I want to show up prepared so that when I have an opinion, people take it seriously."

**Situation:**
"I was working on a group project with 4 people. We had to put together a 3-hour presentation on [topic]. It required a lot of research."

**Task/Challenge:**
"We were split 50/50 on how to approach the final 20% of the project. There was disagreement."

**Action:**
"We decided to focus on the 80% we agreed on first. Once that was in place, we revisited the final 20%. At that point, I could see their vision more clearly and actually changed my mind."

**Result:**
"We ended up getting an A. More importantly, we worked collaboratively and no one's ego got in the way.

I know in the SDR role, I'll be working with AEs, marketing, other SDRs. It's not a solo job. I'll always show up prepared, add value, and work collaboratively - even when we're not always in agreement."
```

**Good Story Topics:**
- Group project with disagreements
- Sports team dynamic
- Work cross-functional project

## Q9: Tell Me About Your Experience in Competitive Environments

### What They're Really Asking
- Are you intrinsically motivated?
- Will you thrive with stack ranks and quotas?
- Do you want to be the best?

### Your Answer Framework

**Structure:**
1. Share where you compete (sports, gym, school, work)
2. Emphasize you focus on controlling what you can control
3. Show you're competitive but collaborative
4. Connect to sales environment

### YOUR ANSWER:

```
[DRAFT YOUR ANSWER HERE]

"I'm someone who loves to compete. One area where I'm in a competitive environment almost every day is [sports / gym / academics].

[Give specific example: e.g., 'When I go to the gym, I have friends there, but I want to be the one putting up the most weight or getting the best time in the workout class.']

I focus on controlling what I can control and performing to the best of my ability. I have fun with it, but I want to win.

At the same time, I realize it's not a zero-sum game. There's more than enough room for everyone to succeed. Part of what makes competitive environments fun is that we're all motivating each other.

That's the type of culture I want to bring to a sales org. I'm going to be the hardest worker. I want to be number one. But when something's working for me, I'll share it with the team. The real competition is [HubSpot/Salesforce/whoever the competitor is], not my peers."
```

**Good Topics:**
- Sports
- Fitness / gym
- Academic competitions
- Work leaderboards / metrics

## Q10: Tell Me About a Time You Took Feedback and Applied It

### What They're Really Asking
- Do you just listen or actually learn?
- Can you apply feedback quickly?
- Do you improve or stay stuck in old habits?

### Your Answer Framework (STAR)

**Key Points:**
- Show you SOUGHT OUT the feedback (proactive)
- Demonstrate immediate application
- Highlight the result/improvement

### YOUR STORY:

```
[DRAFT YOUR ANSWER HERE]

Example Structure:

**Situation:**
"I was working on a three-month project at [work/school]. About one month in, I showed my progress to [boss/professor]."

**Feedback Received:**
"They told me I was way off track. I needed to start from scratch. My first reaction was frustration - I'd put in so much work."

**Action:**
"But I realized they're the expert. They've done this before. So I took their feedback seriously, started over, and applied their guidance."

**Result:**
"The final outcome was way better than the direction I was originally on. I learned more in those last two months than I would have otherwise.

That's how I approach feedback - I don't take it personally. I seek it out, apply it, and use it to get better. I know that's critical in the SDR role, working with you and my AEs."
```

**Alternative Story: Sports/Fitness**
Could also use the varsity tryout story from Q7, focusing on how you applied the coach's feedback on ball control.

- [ ] Listen for:
  - Natural flow (not scripted)
  - Clear structure (STAR)
  - Strong result/takeaway

## Pro Tips for Behavioral Questions

**Use the same story for multiple questions.** The varsity tryout story works for:
- Handling rejection
- Overcoming setbacks
- Taking feedback

**Keep stories tight.** 60-90 seconds max. Interviewers zone out after 2 minutes.

**Always end with the lesson.** Connect your story back to the SDR role:
- "That's how I'll approach [rejection/setbacks/feedback] in this role."

**Practice out loud.** Stories sound different in your head vs. spoken. Record yourself.
