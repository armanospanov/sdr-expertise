## Messaging Framework

### Cold Call Script (Technical Buyer)

```
[Intro]
"Hey [Name], this is Arman from Vonage. Did I catch you at a bad time?"

[If No / Neutral]
"Great. Real quick - the reason I'm calling is we work with [Industry] companies like [Customer Example] who are scaling their customer communication infrastructure.

Most of them were hitting challenges with [reliability / scalability / dev time] using [Twilio / legacy systems].

I'm curious - are you currently using APIs for SMS, voice, or messaging in your product?"

[If Yes]
"Got it. And how's that working for you? Any challenges with [reliability / scaling / integration complexity]?"

[Value Prop]
"The reason I ask is we've helped companies like [Example] reduce [dev time by X% / improve uptime to 99.9% / consolidate from 3 vendors to 1]. 

Would it make sense to spend 15 minutes exploring if there's a fit here?"

[Objection: "We're happy with Twilio"]
"Totally understand. Most of our customers were too - until they hit [specific pain point]. Not saying that's you, but would it hurt to see what else is out there? Worst case, you validate you're with the right vendor."

[Close]
"How's [Day/Time] look for a quick intro call?"
```

### Email Template (Product Leader)

```
Subject: [Company] + omnichannel communication?

Hi [Name],

I saw [Company] recently [raised Series B / launched new product / expanded to EU market]. Congrats.

Quick question: As you're scaling customer communication, are you using a unified platform for SMS, voice, and in-app messaging - or stitching together multiple vendors?

We work with [Industry] companies like [Customer 1] and [Customer 2] who needed:
→ Faster time-to-market for communication features
→ Better customer engagement across channels
→ Unified analytics and insights

Vonage's API platform helped them [specific outcome].

Worth a 15-min conversation?

Best,
Arman
```

### LinkedIn Message (VP Engineering)

```
Hi [Name],

Saw you're building [Product/Feature] at [Company]. Impressive.

Quick question: What's your current API stack for customer communication (SMS, voice, notifications)?

We help [Industry] engineering teams reduce integration complexity and improve reliability. Happy to share what we're seeing in the market.

Open to a quick chat?
```

## How to Present This in the Interview

**When they ask: "How would you approach this role in the first 30 days?"**

You can say:

"I've actually thought through a Day-1 execution plan. Here's how I'd approach it:

**Week 1:** I'd focus on learning - absorbing product training, understanding my territory, and building my first prospecting lists. I'd segment accounts into high-intent, strategic, and volume plays.

**Week 2:** I'd start executing. My goal would be to ramp to full activity targets - 50 dials, 25 emails/day - using a time-blocking system. Morning and late afternoon for cold calls, midday for email and LinkedIn.

**Week 3-4:** I'd be optimizing. Tracking what messaging works, refining my approach based on feedback, and generating my first meetings.

My 30-day goal would be: consistent activity, 8-12 meetings booked, 4-6 opportunities created, and strong relationships with my AEs.

I know the key is to balance volume with quality - hitting activity metrics while also doing deep research on strategic accounts. That's the playbook I used at Spacelift to generate $2.2M in pipeline.

Happy to walk through more details if helpful?"
