# n8n SDR Automation - Start Here

## 📋 What This Is

A complete strategy for automating 60-70% of B2B SDR administrative work using n8n workflows, designed to save 2+ hours per SDR per day.

## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

**Current State**: SDRs spend ~40% of their day on manual work:
- Data enrichment and email finding
- CRM data entry
- Sequence enrollment
- System synchronization (especially LinkedIn ↔ Email)
- Activity logging and reporting

**Target State**: Automate repetitive tasks, keep humans focused on strategy and selling

## 📚 Documentation Structure

Read these in order:

### 1. [Strategic Overview](./documentation/01-strategic-overview.md)
**Read this first**

- Key automation opportunities ranked by impact

### 2. [Tech Stack Scenarios](./documentation/02-tech-stack-scenarios.md)
**Choose your scenario**
- **Scenario A**: Enterprise Stack (SalesNav + Apollo + Salesforce + Outreach + LinkedHelper)
- **Scenario B**: SMB Stack (Apollo + HubSpot + Lemlist + LinkedHelper)
- Detailed workflow sequences for each
- Implementation time estimates

### 3. [Implementation Roadmap](./documentation/03-implementation-roadmap.md)
**How to build it**
- Phased approach: 4 phases over 6 weeks
- What to build first, second, third (prioritized by ROI)
- Technical requirements and testing protocols
- Success metrics for each phase

### 4. [LinkedHelper Workaround](./documentation/04-linkedhelper-workaround.md)
**Critical: LinkedIn ↔ Email sync**
- Deep dive on the biggest integration challenge
- CSV file exchange workaround strategy
- Edge case handling
- Required Salesforce custom fields

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Option 1: Full Implementation (Recommended)

**Time**: 6 weeks
**Outcome**: 6-7 automated workflows, ~65% automation coverage

1. ✅ Read all documentation
2. ✅ Choose your tech stack scenario
3. ✅ Set up n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)
4. ✅ Gather API credentials (Hunter.io, Apollo, CRM, email tool)
5. ✅ Phase 1: Build data enrichment pipeline (Week 1-2)
6. ✅ Phase 2: Build email automation (Week 3)
7. ✅ Phase 3: Build LinkedIn integration (Week 4)
8. ✅ Phase 4: Build reporting layer (Week 5-6)

### Option 2: Proof of Concept (Start Small)

**Time**: 1-2 weeks
**Outcome**: 1-2 workflows, validate approach

1. ✅ Read Strategic Overview + Tech Stack Scenarios
2. ✅ Set up n8n
3. ✅ Build Workflow #1: Multi-Source Enrichment Pipeline only
4. ✅ Test with 50-100 leads
5. ✅ Measure time savings
6. ✅ If successful, continue with full implementation

## 📊 Expected Results

### Time Savings (Per SDR)
- **Before**: 3 hours/day on admin work
- **After**: 45 minutes/day on admin work
- **Saved**: 2+ hours/day freed up for selling

### Quality Improvements
- ✅ Duplicate creation rate: <2%
- ✅ Email validation accuracy: 95%+
- ✅ Multi-channel sync: 95%+ (no embarrassing double-touches)
- ✅ Data entry errors: Near zero

### Process Improvements
- Campaign launch: 2 hours → 30 minutes
- Meeting handoff: 20 minutes → 2 minutes
- Daily reporting: 1 hour → automated

## 🛠️ Required Tools & Accounts

### Core Infrastructure
- **n8n** (self-hosted or cloud)
- **Dropbox or Google Drive** (for CSV file exchange)
- **Slack** (for alerts and notifications)

### Data Enrichment
- **Hunter.io** (email finding & validation)
- **Apollo** or **Cognism** (data enrichment)
- Optional: NeverBounce, Clearbit

### CRM
Choose one:
- **Salesforce** (Enterprise)
- **HubSpot** (SMB)

### Email Outreach
Choose one:
- **Outreach** (Enterprise)
- **Lemlist** (SMB)

### LinkedIn Automation
- **LinkedHelper** (desktop or VM-based)

### Optional
- **Calendly** or **Chili Piper** (meeting scheduling)
- **Apify** (if Apollo API limits are hit)

## 💡 Key Insights from Strategic Analysis

### What Works Well
1. **Data enrichment pipelines** (100% automatable, high ROI)
2. **CRM import automation** (eliminates human error)
3. **Email sequence enrollment** (fully automatable)
4. **Meeting handoff** (smooth AE transitions)

### The Biggest Challenge: LinkedHelper Integration
LinkedHelper has **no API**, creating a manual gap in multi-channel outreach. 

**Our Solution**: CSV file exchange workaround
- n8n exports optimized CSV for LinkedHelper (automated)
- Human uploads CSV to LinkedHelper VM (manual, ~5 min)
- LinkedHelper exports daily activity CSV (automated)
- n8n processes activities and syncs back to CRM (automated)

**Result**: ~90% automation despite API limitation

### Where Humans Still Add Value
- **Strategic targeting** (ICP definition, account selection)
- **Messaging quality** (crafting compelling copy)
- **Qualification** (evaluating fit, budget, authority, need)
- **Exception handling** (resolving conflicting data)
- **Relationship building** (the actual selling)

## 🎓 Learning Approach

If you're new to n8n automation:

1. **Start simple**: Build Workflow #1 (enrichment) first
2. **Measure everything**: Time before vs. after automation
3. **Iterate**: Each workflow should get easier as you learn
4. **Don't skip testing**: Parallel run with manual process before full cutover
5. **Document**: Future you will thank present you
