# Day 4: Messaging Creation

> **Time Required:** 6-8 hours  
> **Goal:** Create segment-specific email sequences and call scripts that resonate

## üéØ Overview

Now that you have 6 segmented lists, you need messaging that speaks directly to each segment's pain points. Generic messages get ignored. Segment-specific messages get replies.

You're building:
- **4-email sequences** for each segment (24 emails total)
- **Call scripts** for each segment (6 scripts total)

## üìß Email Sequence Structure

For each segment, create a 4-email sequence:

### Email 1: Value Prop Introduction
**Goal:** Get their attention with relevance
- Subject line (7 words max)
- Opening line (personalized)
- Problem statement (their specific pain)
- Solution hint (how you solve it)
- CTA (ask for 15-min call)

### Email 2: Short Follow-Up
**Goal:** Stay top of mind without being pushy
- 2-3 sentences max
- Reference first email
- Add new insight or stat
- Soft CTA (reply or meet)

### Email 3: Ultra-Short
**Goal:** Break through inbox clutter
- 1-2 sentences
- Direct question
- Easy reply threshold

### Email 4: Breakup Email
**Goal:** Create urgency or get definitive "no"
- Acknowledge no response
- Final value statement
- Permission to stop reaching out
- Door-closing CTA

**Permission (5 seconds):**
- "Is now a good time for 2 minutes?"
- OR "Did I catch you at a bad time?"

**Value Statement (30 seconds):**
- Their likely problem
- How you solve it
- Outcome/proof point

**Discovery Question (10 seconds):**
- Open-ended question about their situation
- Gets them talking

**CTA (15 seconds):**
- Suggest next step (meeting)
- Provide specific time options

**Template:** `../templates/04-call-script-template.md`

**ü§ñ AI Prompt for Call Script:**
```
Create a cold call script for this segment:

**Persona:** [TITLE] at [COMPANY TYPE]
**Pain Points:** [LIST TOP 3]
**Our Solution:** [WHAT YOU DO]
**Proof Point:** [CUSTOMER RESULT]

Script structure:
1. Opening (15 sec) - Name, company, reason for call
2. Permission ask (5 sec)
3. Value statement (30 sec) - Their problem + how we solve
4. Discovery question (10 sec) - Get them talking
5. CTA (15 sec) - Book meeting

Requirements:
- Conversational, not scripted-sounding
- Focus on their problem first
- Include a pattern interrupt
- Natural pauses for them to respond
- Handle common brush-offs

Total script: ~75 seconds if spoken naturally.
```

#### 4. Objection Handling Add-Ons

For each script, add responses to top 5 objections:

1. **"Not interested"**
   - Response: "I totally understand. Can I ask - is it not a priority, or just not the right time?"

2. **"Send me info"**
   - Response: "Happy to. Before I do, quick question: [discovery question]?"

3. **"We already have a solution"**
   - Response: "That's great. What are you using? [Listen] How's it working for [specific pain]?"

4. **"Too busy right now"**
   - Response: "Fair enough. That's actually why I'm calling - we help [persona] save [X hours/week] on [task]. Worth 10 minutes next week?"

5. **"Call me back later"**
   - Response: "Absolutely. When's a better time? I'm looking at [day] at [time] or [day] at [time]?"

**Use Template:** `../templates/05-objection-bank-template.md` (expand on Day 1-2 version)

#### 5. Segment-Specific Customization

Review each script and customize:
- [ ] Industry-specific pain points
- [ ] Persona-level language/terminology
- [ ] Relevant customer examples
- [ ] Appropriate tone (formal vs. casual)
- [ ] Timing sensitivity (when they're likely available)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Email Writing Principles

### Do:
- Keep Email 1 under 100 words
- Use "you/your" more than "I/we/our"
- Lead with problem, not solution
- Include specific proof points (numbers)
- Make CTA easy (single clear ask)
- Write like you talk

### Don't:
- Use marketing speak or jargon
- Make it about your company
- Include multiple CTAs
- Write paragraphs (use line breaks)
- Use attachments in Email 1
- Write in ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation!!!

## ü§ñ AI-Assisted Message Refinement

After writing first drafts, use this prompt:

```
Review this cold email:

[PASTE EMAIL]

Target: [PERSONA] at [COMPANY TYPE]
Pain point: [PROBLEM]
Goal: Book 15-min call

Critique:
1. Is the subject line compelling?
2. Does the opening grab attention?
3. Is the problem statement specific?
4. Is the CTA clear and easy?
5. Is it too long/too short?
6. Does it sound salesy or authentic?
7. Specific improvements?

Provide a revised version that's better.
```

## üí¨ Call Script Best Practices

### Do:
- Sound confident but not arrogant
- Pause after asking questions
- Use their name naturally
- Smile when you talk (they can hear it)
- Stand up when calling (better energy)
- Have your script visible but don't read it

### Don't:
- Rush through the script
- Talk over them
- Argue with objections
- Apologize for calling
- Ask "How are you?" (wastes time)
- Say "I was just calling.." (sounds unimportant)

## üí° Pro Tips

### Email Subject Lines:
- Keep under 50 characters
- Avoid: Free, Sale, Limited Time, !!!, ALL CAPS
- Test: Question vs. Statement
- Use: Numbers, specificity, curiosity

**Examples:**
- Bad: "Great solution for your company"
- Better: "2 min on [their problem]?"
- Best: "[Mutual connection] suggested I reach out"

### Call Opening Lines:
- Bad: "How are you today?"
- Better: "I know I'm calling out of the blue..."
- Best: "Hey [Name], this is [You] from [Company]. I'm calling because [specific reason]. Is now a terrible time?"
