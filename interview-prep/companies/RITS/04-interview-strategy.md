# RITS - Vonage Interview Strategy

## Pre-Interview Mindset

**Remember:**
- You're interviewing them too
- You have $2.2M in proven results - you're not begging for a job
- This is a conversation, not an interrogation
- Your goal: Determine if this is the right mutual fit

---

## Opening Strong (First 90 Seconds)

**They'll likely start with: "Tell me about yourself"**

Your Answer (Memorize the Framework):
```
"Thanks for the opportunity. I'm from [location], studied CS at [university]. I've always been competitive - [sports/work example].

I moved into tech sales 4+ years ago because I liked the idea of a performance-based career. At Spacelift, I generated $2.2M in SQL pipeline this year, hit 94% of quota managing 6-month enterprise cycles.

What excites me about Vonage is the combination of clear career progression, working on API/developer products - which aligns with my CS background - and joining a stable enterprise after 4+ years in startups.

I'm thinking 3-5 years out, and I see Vonage as the place to build that career. So that's what brought me here. Curious to learn more about the role and how I can add value."
```

**Why this works:**
- Concise (under 90 seconds)
- Leads with results ($2.2M)
- Explains why Vonage specifically
- Ends with curiosity (not desperation)

## Positioning Your Spacelift Experience

### If They Ask: "Why leave Spacelift?"

**Your Answer:**
```
"Great question. I loved my time at Spacelift - learned a ton, generated strong results, worked with an incredible team.

But I'm at a point in my career where I'm looking for a few specific things:

1. **Career structure:** I want a clear SDR→AE promotion path in a company that invests in long-term development. Spacelift is a smaller startup (30-50 people) without that formalized structure yet.

2. **Enterprise stability:** After 4+ years in high-growth startups, I want to build skills in a more mature sales org with established processes, playbooks, and coaching.

3. **Product market:** I want to stay in technical/API sales where my CS degree and DevOps experience add value. Vonage's CPaaS platform is a natural fit.

I'm not running from anything - I'm running toward a specific career trajectory that Vonage offers."
```

**Key Points:**
- Frame it as career growth (not fleeing)
- Emphasize structure and stability (what Vonage has)
- Show long-term thinking

### If They Ask: "What did you learn at Spacelift?"

**Your Answer:**
```
"Spacelift taught me how to sell in a 0-to-1 environment:

- **Building from scratch:** I helped establish the EMEA outbound motion - messaging, ICP, territory strategy
- **Technical selling:** I learned how to have discovery calls with DevOps engineers and platform teams - understanding their infrastructure, pain points, and workflows
- **Enterprise cycles:** I managed 6-month sales cycles with multiple stakeholders, navigating procurement, security reviews, etc.
- **Scrappiness:** In a startup, you wear many hats. I influenced product roadmap, represented us at events, built automation tools.

Now I want to take those skills and apply them in a more structured environment where I can learn from proven playbooks and scale my impact."
```

## Addressing Potential Concerns

### Concern: "You've been at multiple companies. Are you a job-hopper?"

**Your Answer:**
```
"Fair question. Here's the context:

- **SALESmanago (5 months):** Early pandemic, company pivoted strategy. Not the right fit.
- **HCM Deck (14 months):** Great learning experience, but I wanted to move into more technical sales.
- **Migrant Help (side project):** This is a side business I run for legal services. Not a full-time role.
- **Spacelift (2 years):** My longest tenure. Generated $2.2M in pipeline, proved I can execute and stay.

I'm now looking for a 3-5 year home where I can grow from SDR → AE → Enterprise AE or Management. That's why I'm here. I'm done exploring - I'm ready to commit and build."
```

### Concern: "Why go from a startup back to enterprise?"

**Your Answer:**
```
"I've learned a ton in startups - scrappiness, building from scratch, wearing multiple hats. But I've realized I want to master the craft of selling in a structured environment.

In startups, you're figuring it out as you go. At Vonage, I can learn from:
- Established playbooks
- Experienced managers and AEs
- Proven methodologies
- Clear career paths

I want to build world-class SDR and AE skills, and the best place to do that is in a mature sales org. Then I can take those skills anywhere."
```

### Concern: "Can you handle the volume/grind?"

**Your Answer:**
```
"Absolutely. At Spacelift, I consistently hit 50+ dials and 25+ emails per day while managing a 6-month enterprise pipeline.

The key is time blocking:
- 9-11 AM and 4-5 PM: Pure calling blocks (peak hours)
- Midday: Email sequences, LinkedIn, research
- I protect my prospecting time like it's sacred

Volume is a muscle. I've built it. And I know that consistent activity is what generates consistent pipeline."
```

## Questions to Ask THEM

### Round 1: Hiring Manager

**About the Role:**
1. "What does success look like for an SDR in the first 90 days? First year?"
2. "Can you walk me through the SDR-to-AE promotion process? What's the typical timeline and criteria?"
3. "How do SDRs and AEs collaborate here? What does the handoff process look like?"

**About Coaching:**
4. "How do you coach your team? What's the feedback cadence like?"
5. "What do your top-performing SDRs do differently?"

**About the Product/Market:**
6. "What are the most common pain points you hear from prospects? How does Vonage typically win against Twilio?"
7. "What buyer personas convert best - technical decision-makers or business buyers?"

### Round 2: AE or Peer SDR

**About Day-to-Day:**
1. "Walk me through your typical week. How do you structure your time?"
2. "What's been your biggest challenge in the role? How did you overcome it?"
3. "What do you wish you knew when you started?"

**About Collaboration:**
4. "How do you and your SDR/AE partner work together? Weekly syncs? Territory planning?"
5. "What makes a great SDR-AE partnership here?"

**About Culture:**
6. "What's the team dynamic like? How do SDRs support each other?"
7. "What do you like most about working at Vonage?"

### Round 3: Leadership (VP Sales, etc.)

**About Vision:**
1. "What's the vision for the SDR team over the next 1-2 years?"
2. "How does Vonage think about career development for SDRs?"
3. "What's driving Vonage's growth right now? What markets are you expanding into?"

**About Expectations:**
4. "What separates a good SDR from a great one here?"
5. "What would make me successful in this role?"

## Handling Tough Questions

### "Why didn't you get promoted to AE at Spacelift?"

**Your Answer:**
```
"Great question. Spacelift is a small startup (30-50 people) with only 2-3 AE roles. There wasn't a formal promotion path or open AE headcount during my tenure.

I could have waited, but I realized I wanted to be in an environment with:
- Clear promotion criteria
- Multiple AE roles opening regularly
- Formalized training and development

That's why I'm here. I want a company that invests in SDR-to-AE development, and Vonage has that track record."
```

### "Your experience is mostly startup. Can you adapt to enterprise processes?"

**Your Answer:**
```
"That's exactly what I'm looking for. I want to learn enterprise rigor:
- Structured sales methodologies (MEDDPICC, etc.)
- Formal CRM hygiene and pipeline management
- Cross-functional collaboration at scale

I've managed 6-month enterprise sales cycles at Spacelift, so I understand complex stakeholder management. Now I want to do that within a mature org with proven systems.

I'm coachable, I take feedback, and I apply it quickly. That's how I've succeeded everywhere I've been."
```

### "What's your greatest weakness as an SDR?"

**Your Answer:**
```
"I'm someone who likes to be fully prepared before diving in. Early on, I'd spend too much time researching before making a call.

I've learned to batch that work - build my lists in advance, create templates, research upfront - so that during calling blocks, I can just execute.

But I'm still working on balancing preparation with speed. Sometimes you just need to pick up the phone and learn in real-time. That's something I actively focus on."
```

## Closing the Interview Strong

### When They Ask: "Do you have any questions for us?"

**Your Approach:**
```
"Yes, a few:

[Ask 2-3 questions from the sections above]

And one more: Based on our conversation today, do you have any concerns about my fit for this role that I can address?"
```

**Why this works:**
- Shows you're listening (ask relevant questions)
- Gives them a chance to surface concerns
- You can address objections in real-time

### When They Ask: "Why should we hire you?"

**Your Answer:**
```
"Three reasons:

**1. Proven Results:** I've generated $2.2M in pipeline using the exact multi-channel playbook you need. I know how to execute.

**2. Technical Credibility:** With a CS degree and 2+ years selling DevOps/Infrastructure, I can have technical discovery calls and qualify API buyers effectively. That's critical for Vonage.

**3. Long-Term Commitment:** I'm looking for a 3-5 year home to build a career, not just a job. I want to master the SDR role, promote to AE, and grow within Vonage.

You're not just getting someone who can do the job - you're getting someone who will make the team better, apply feedback quickly, and be here for the long haul."
```
