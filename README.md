## Featured Insights

> **On Multi-Touch Cadences:**  
> "70% of SDRs give up after one email, yet 70% of meetings come from follow-ups. The ABAB cadence framework ensures persistent, non-spammy outreach."

> **On Technical Buyers:**  
> "DevOps and infrastructure buyers respond 40% better to problem-focused messaging vs. feature-based pitches. Lead with their pain, not your product."

> **On Automation:**  
> "The right automation amplifies quality, not quantity. Use n8n/Zapier to eliminate admin work, not to spam at scale."
