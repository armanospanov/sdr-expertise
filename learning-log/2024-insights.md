# 2024 SDR Learning Log

## Q3 2024

### Experiment: AI-Powered Email Personalization
**Hypothesis:** Using ChatGPT to generate prospect-specific insights would improve reply rates  
**Approach:** For 50 prospects, researched their LinkedIn + company news, fed to ChatGPT with prompt: "What pain points might this person have regarding [our solution]?"  
**Result:** Reply rate increased from 9% to 14%  
**Learning:** AI-generated insights are valuable but require human validation. 2 out of 50 had completely wrong assumptions. Best use: AI generates 3 hypotheses, SDR picks the most credible one.  
**Status:** Implementing as standard for Tier 1 accounts only (not scalable for all)

### Insight: LinkedIn Engagement Pre-Outreach
**Observation:** Started engaging with prospect posts 1-2 weeks before cold email  
**Action:** Commented thoughtfully on 3-5 posts per target account  
**Impact:** 18% higher positive reply rate vs. cold outreach  
**Theory:** Prospects recognized my name when email arrived, lowering barrier  
**Tradeoff:** Time-intensive (15 min per prospect). Only viable for high-value targets.

## Q2 2024

### Experiment: Video Prospecting
**Hypothesis:** Personalized video messages would stand out in crowded inboxes  
**Tool Used:** Loom  
**Approach:** Recorded 30-60 second videos for 30 high-value prospects  
**Result:** 23% reply rate (vs. 10% baseline)  
**Challenges:**  
- Time-consuming (5 min per video)  
- Video views were only 60% (many didn't watch)  
- Hard to scale  
**Learning:** Video works exceptionally well for breaking into strategic accounts but isn't scalable for volume. Reserve for Top 20 dream accounts per quarter.

### Insight: Call Script Restructuring
**Change:** Moved from "How are you?" opener to immediate value statement  
**Before:** "Hi, this is Arman. How are you today?"  
**After:** "Hi [Name], this is Arman from [Company]. The reason I'm calling is..."  
**Result:** Reduced hang-ups by ~15%, more prospects stayed on line  
**Theory:** Removing pleasantries signaled respect for their time, got to value faster

## Q1 2024

### Experiment: Subject Line Testing
**Test:** Question vs. Statement subject lines  
**Example A:** "Cutting your model training time?" (question)  
**Example B:** "Cutting model training time at [Company]" (statement)  
**Result:** Questions performed 8% better open rates  
**Surprise:** Both converted to meetings at similar rates (questions didn't lead to more meetings)  
**Learning:** Questions drive opens but don't necessarily drive quality. Use questions for broad outreach, statements for targeted campaigns.

### Insight: Objection Handling - "Send Me Info"
**Old Response:** Sent deck, then waited  
**New Response:** "Happy to send a deck, but in my experience a 15-min walkthrough is more valuable. How about we schedule that and I'll send the deck beforehand?"  
**Result:** 40% of "send info" requests converted to meetings (vs. 5% before)  
**Learning:** "Send me info" is usually a brush-off. Pushing for meeting with deck as pre-read reframes the ask.
