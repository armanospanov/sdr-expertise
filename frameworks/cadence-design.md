# ABAB Cadence Design Framework

## What is ABAB?

The ABAB cadence is a multi-touch prospecting framework that alternates between two groups of prospects (A and B) on different days. This creates a sustainable daily rhythm that combines **new outreach** and **follow-ups** without overwhelming the SDR or the prospect.

**Core Principle:** Most meetings come from follow-ups (70%+ of email-sourced meetings), yet 70% of SDRs give up after one touch. ABAB ensures persistent, structured follow-up without being spammy.

## The 5-Day ABAB Schedule

### Monday (Day 1): Launch Group A
- Send initial email to Group A (~40-50 prospects)
- Send LinkedIn connection requests to Group A
- Optional: Light research/prep for Tuesday's calls

### Tuesday (Day 2): Launch Group B + Follow Group A
- Send initial email to Group B (~40-50 new prospects)
- **Call Group A** (who received email yesterday)
- Send LinkedIn connection requests to Group B

### Wednesday (Day 3): Follow Both Groups
- Send **Follow-up #1 email** to Group A
- **Call Group B** (who received email yesterday)
- Respond to any replies from Mon/Tue

### Thursday (Day 4): Continue Follow-ups
- Send **Follow-up #1 email** to Group B
- **Call Group A again** (2nd call attempt)
- Respond to replies

### Friday (Day 5): Final Push
- Send **Follow-up #2** to both Group A & B
- **Call Group B again** (2nd call attempt)
- Clean up CRM, plan next week's groups

## Touchpoint Breakdown

By end of Week 1, each prospect receives:
- **3 emails** (Initial, Follow-up #1, Follow-up #2)
- **2 call attempts** (with voicemail on 2nd attempt)
- **1 LinkedIn connection request**
- **Optional:** LinkedIn post engagement

**Total: 6-7 touchpoints over 5 business days**

## Why ABAB Works

### 1. **Prevents Burnout**
Every day has a clear structure. No decision fatigue about "what should I do today?"

### 2. **Ensures Follow-ups Happen**
Follow-ups are baked into the schedule. You can't forget them.

### 3. **Scales Without Feeling Spammy**
Touches are spaced 2-3 days apart, which feels respectful but persistent.

### 4. **Maintains High Volume**
80-100 new prospects per week (2 groups of 40-50) with consistent follow-up.

### 5. **Gamifies the Process**
"Hit Group A today, Group B tomorrow" creates a rhythm that's almost meditative.

## Cadence Templates

### Email Sequence

**Email 1 (Day 1/2):** Initial value proposition
- Subject: [Pain-focused or curiosity-driven]
- Body: Who, Why, What (150 words max)
- CTA: Assumptive meeting ask with 2 time options

**Email 2 (Day 3/4):** Short follow-up
```
Hi {{first_name}},

Just following up on my note below—are you open to 
discussing how we might help with {{pain_point}}?

Thanks!
{{your_name}}
```

**Email 3 (Day 5):** Ultra-short nudge
```
{{first_name}},

Please give me your thoughts on this.

{{your_name}}
```

### Call Approach

**Call 1 (Day 2/3):** 
- No voicemail (test if they call back)
- If connect: Deliver value statement, ask for meeting

**Call 2 (Day 4/5):**
- Leave voicemail: "Hi {{name}}, {{your_name}} from {{company}}. We help {{industry}} with {{value}}. I emailed earlier this week—feel free to reply or call me at {{number}}. Thanks!"

## Advanced Tactics

### Multi-Threading
If targeting enterprise accounts, consider:
- Group A = Persona 1 (e.g., Head of Engineering)
- Group B = Persona 2 (e.g., CTO at same companies)

This hits multiple stakeholders at one account without overwhelming any single person.

### Extended Cadence (Optional Day 8-10)
If no response by Day 5, add:
- **Day 8:** Breakup email ("Should I stay or should I go?")
- **Day 10:** Final touch with case study or relevant content

Then **move on** or mark for re-engagement in 3-6 months.

## Tools & Automation

### Required Tools
- **Email sequencer** (Apollo, Outreach, Salesloft) - automates email sends
- **CRM** (Salesforce, HubSpot) - tracks interactions
- **Dialer** - for efficient calling
- **Calendar** (Calendly) - easy meeting scheduling

### Automation Setup
1. Load Group A into sequence on Monday
2. Load Group B into sequence on Tuesday
3. Sequence auto-sends emails at scheduled times
4. **Manual tasks:** Calls and LinkedIn (can't fully automate)

### Stop Conditions
- **Auto-pause on reply:** If prospect responds, remove from sequence
- **Auto-pause on meeting booked:** Mark as SQL, stop outreach
- **Manual pause:** If prospect says "not interested," mark DNC

- Emails sent
- Calls made
- LinkedIn connections sent

### Output Metrics
- Reply rate (target: 8-10%)
- Meeting booking rate (target: 20-30% of replies)
- Overall conversion: Prospects → Meetings (target: 4-6%)

### Optimization Metrics
- Best performing email (by reply rate)
- Best call time (by connect rate)
- Optimal follow-up spacing (test 2-day vs 3-day gaps)

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Giving up after Email 1**
✅ Most meetings come from touches 3-5

❌ **Sending all touches same day**
✅ Space them 2-3 days apart for "top of mind" effect

❌ **Using same message for all follow-ups**
✅ Vary the angle slightly (value → social proof → breakup)

❌ **Not calling**
✅ Calls convert 2-3x better than email alone for strategic accounts

❌ **Forgetting to respond to replies**
✅ Respond within 2 hours when possible

## Customization Guidelines

**For SMB/High Volume:**
- Increase group size to 75-100
- Reduce personalization
- Shorten cadence to 3-4 days

**For Enterprise/Strategic:**
- Decrease group size to 20-30
- Increase personalization (custom videos, research)
- Extend cadence to 10 days with more touches

**For Different Industries:**
- Technical buyers: Lead with pain/ROI
- Business buyers: Lead with outcomes/case studies
- C-level: Keep it ultra-concise, reference strategic priorities

---

## Integration with Other Frameworks

- **Use with Persona Research:** Each group should be homogeneous (same persona, same pain)
- **Use with Messaging Framework:** Plug in "Who, Why, What" templates
- **Use with Qualification:** Have qualification questions ready for replies

---

## Key Takeaway

The ABAB cadence is not just a schedule—it's a **philosophy of respectful persistence**. You're not spamming; you're systematically ensuring your message reaches prospects during their "ready to engage" window, which might not be Day 1.
