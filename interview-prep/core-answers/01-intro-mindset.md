## Q5: What Are Your Strengths and Weaknesses?

### What They're Really Asking
- Are you self-aware?
- Are you coachable?
- Do you know where your blind spots are?

### Your Answer Framework

**Strengths (Pick 3):**
1. Hard worker
2. Coachable
3. Team player

**Weakness:**
- Be genuine
- Share what you're doing to overcome it

### YOUR STRENGTHS:

```
[DRAFT YOUR ANSWER HERE]

**Strength 1: Hard Worker**
"I'm someone who shows up early, stays late, and grinds. Whether it's [school/sports/work], hard work is my base. When everything else goes wrong, I know I can control my effort."

**Strength 2: Coachable**
"I consider myself very coachable. The fastest way to learn isn't trial and error - it's learning from people like you who've done this before. I actively seek feedback and apply it quickly."

**Strength 3: Team Player**
"When something works for me, I share it with the team. Sales is competitive, but there's more than enough room for everyone to win. I want to help make the whole org better."
```

### YOUR WEAKNESS:

```
[DRAFT YOUR ANSWER HERE]

Example (genuine weakness):
"I'm someone who likes to be fully prepared before diving in. In school, I'd plan out every paragraph of an essay before writing. That's great for planning, but in sales, sometimes you need to just pick up the phone and rip dials.

So my way of overcoming this is doing all the prep work in advance - building lists, creating scripts, researching accounts - so that when it's time to prospect, I can just execute without overthinking."
```

**Good Weakness Options:**
- Over-preparing (but you're working on it)
- Impatience with results (but you're learning to trust the process)
- Taking rejection personally early on (but you've developed resilience)

**Bad Weakness Options:**
- ❌ "I'm a workaholic" (fake)
- ❌ "I care too much" (cliché)
- ❌ "I'm not good with people" (dealbreaker for sales)
