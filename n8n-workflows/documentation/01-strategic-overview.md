# SDR Workflow Automation - Strategic Overview

## Executive Summary

**Goal**: Automate 60-70% of B2B SDR administrative work using n8n, freeing up 2+ hours per day per SDR for actual selling activities.

**Current State**: SDRs spend ~40% of their day (3 hours) on manual data entry, list building, and system synchronization.

**Target State**: Reduce admin time to ~10% of day (45 minutes) through intelligent automation with strategic human-in-loop checkpoints.

### Stage 1: ICP/Account Selection
**Type**: Strategic/Manual
- Define target companies, industries, company size
- **Human Decision Required**: Strategic targeting based on business context

### Stage 2: Lead List Building
**Type**: Hybrid (Manual + Tool-Assisted)
- Tools: SalesNav, Apollo, Cognism
- **Human Decision Required**: List quality review, persona selection

### Stage 3: Data Export
**Type**: Manual (Technical Bottleneck)
- SalesNav → CSV export OR push to Apollo
- **Bottleneck**: SalesNav has no direct API

### Stage 4: Data Enrichment
**Type**: 100% Automatable ✅
- Get emails: Hunter.io, Apollo API
- Get phone numbers: Apollo, Cognism
- Company data enrichment
- **n8n Workflow**: Multi-source enrichment with fallback logic

### Stage 5: Data Validation
**Type**: 100% Automatable ✅
- Email verification: Hunter.io, NeverBounce
- Phone validation: Twilio Lookup
- Duplicate detection: CRM cross-check
- **n8n Workflow**: Full validation pipeline with confidence scoring

### Stage 6: CRM Import & Organization
**Type**: 95% Automatable ✅
- Import to Salesforce/HubSpot
- Lead/Contact creation with field mapping
- Campaign/List assignment
- **n8n Workflow**: Auto-import with deduplication
- **Human Review**: Final segmentation rule validation

### Stage 7A: Email Sequence Enrollment
**Type**: 100% Automatable ✅
- Outreach/Lemlist sequence enrollment
- Personalization token mapping
- **n8n Workflow**: Triggered by CRM status change

### Stage 7B: LinkedIn Sequence Enrollment
**Type**: Semi-Manual ⚠️ (CRITICAL BOTTLENECK)
- LinkedHelper requires CSV upload to VM
- **No API = No real-time sync**
- **n8n Workflow**: Prepare optimized CSV
- **Human Action Required**: Upload CSV to LinkedHelper VM

### Stage 8: Response Monitoring & Sync
**Type**: 90% Automatable ⚠️
- **THE CRITICAL PROBLEM**: LinkedIn response → Must manually stop email sequence
- **n8n Solution**: Monitor LinkedHelper CSV exports + Salesforce status → Auto-pause Outreach
- **Human Alert**: Slack notification when activity detected

### Stage 9: Meeting Scheduling
**Type**: 90% Automatable ✅
- Calendar link sharing (Calendly/Chili Piper)
- **n8n Workflow**: Calendly webhook → Salesforce update → AE notification
- **Human Decision**: Qualify fit, reschedule if needed

### Stage 10: Pipeline Management & Reporting
**Type**: 95% Automatable ✅
- Activity logging and metrics aggregation
- **n8n Workflow**: Multi-source data → Dashboard updates
- **Human Analysis**: Interpret trends, adjust strategy
