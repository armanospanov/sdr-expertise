# Tech Stack Scenarios

Different companies use different tool combinations. Here are the two most common scenarios with specific n8n workflow implementations.

---

## Scenario A: Enterprise Stack

**Tools**: SalesNav + Apollo + Salesforce + Outreach + LinkedHelper

### Workflow Sequence

**Step 1**: Manual - Build list in SalesNav
- Human strategic decision on targeting
- Export to CSV OR push to Apollo

**Step 2**: ðŸ¤– n8n Workflow #1 - Multi-Source Enrichment
- Input: CSV with names + company domains
- Process:
  - Apollo API enrichment (emails, phones, firmographic data)
  - Hunter.io email validation (fallback if Apollo fails)
  - NeverBounce verification (confidence scoring)
  - Deduplication check against existing CRM data
- Output: Validated, enriched CSV with confidence scores
- Time saved: 2-3 hours per 500 contacts

**Step 3**: ðŸ¤– n8n Workflow #2 - Salesforce Import
- Input: Enriched CSV from Workflow #1
- Process:
  - Check Salesforce for existing leads/contacts (by email + LinkedIn URL)
  - Create new leads if not found
  - Update existing records if found (append new data)
  - Assign to appropriate campaigns
  - Apply lead scoring rules
  - Set ownership (round-robin or territory-based)
- Output: Clean CRM data ready for sequences
- Time saved: 1-2 hours per import

**Step 4**: ðŸ¤– n8n Workflow #3 - Outreach Auto-Enrollment
- Input: Salesforce campaign membership (new leads)
- Trigger: New lead added to campaign OR status changed to "Ready for Outreach"
- Process:
  - Map Salesforce fields â†’ Outreach custom fields
  - Enroll in specified sequence
  - Set send schedule (timezone-aware)
  - Apply personalization tokens
- Output: Leads automatically in email sequences
- Time saved: 30-45 minutes per campaign

**Step 5**: ðŸ¤– n8n Workflow #4 - LinkedHelper CSV Optimizer
- Input: Salesforce campaign members
- Process:
  - Export relevant fields
  - Format for LinkedHelper requirements:
    - LinkedIn URL (required)
    - First Name, Last Name
    - Custom Field 1, Custom Field 2 (for personalization)
    - Company Name, Title
  - Save to Dropbox/Google Drive designated folder
  - Send Slack notification: "CSV ready for LinkedHelper - 247 contacts"
- Output: Ready-to-upload CSV
- Time saved: 20-30 minutes per campaign

**Step 6**: Manual - LinkedHelper CSV Upload
- Human action: Download CSV, upload to LinkedHelper VM, start campaign
- Why manual: LinkedHelper has no API

**Step 7**: ðŸ¤– n8n Workflow #5 - LinkedIn/Email Sequence Sync (CRITICAL)
- Input: 
  - Option A: Watch Dropbox/Drive folder for LinkedHelper daily activity CSVs
  - Option B: Poll Salesforce for manual status updates
- Process:
  - Parse LinkedHelper CSV for activities:
    - "Reply Received"
    - "Connection Accepted + Message Exchanged"
    - "Meeting Scheduled"
  - Match LinkedIn URL to Salesforce lead
  - Update Salesforce status field
  - Trigger Outreach API: Pause sequence for this lead
  - Send Slack alert to SDR: "LinkedIn activity detected for [Name] - Outreach paused"
- Output: Synchronized multi-channel outreach
- Impact: **Prevents embarrassing double-touches**
- Time saved: 1-2 hours per week checking manually

**Step 8**: ðŸ¤– n8n Workflow #6 - Meeting Handoff Automation
- Input: Calendly webhook (meeting booked)
- Process:
  - Update Salesforce: Meeting date/time, mark as "Meeting Scheduled"
  - Create Opportunity (if qualified)
  - Assign to AE (based on territory or round-robin)
  - Send AE Slack notification with prospect context
  - Send prospect confirmation email with prep instructions
  - Add to AE's Google Calendar
- Output: Smooth SDR â†’ AE handoff
- Time saved: 15-20 minutes per meeting

- Meeting qualification (Step 8)

### Total Automation Coverage: ~65%

  - Export with LinkedHelper-specific formatting
  - Save to designated folder
  - Slack notification
- Output: Ready-to-upload CSV
- Time saved: 15-20 minutes per campaign

**Step 6**: Manual - LinkedHelper Upload
- Same as Enterprise scenario

**Step 7**: ðŸ¤– n8n Workflow #5 - Sequence Sync via HubSpot
- Input: 
  - LinkedHelper CSV export (daily)
  - OR HubSpot workflow triggers (manual property updates)
- Process:
  - Detect LinkedIn activity
  - Update HubSpot contact property: "LinkedIn Status"
  - Trigger Lemlist API: Remove from campaign
  - Slack alert to SDR
