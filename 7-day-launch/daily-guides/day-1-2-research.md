# Day 1-2: Research & Intelligence

> **Time Required:** 8-12 hours (spread over 2 days)  
> **Goal:** Become dangerous enough to sound credible in conversations and emails

## 🎯 Overview

You're not trying to become a product expert. You're trying to learn *just enough* to:
1. Sound credible when you reach out
2. Ask intelligent qualifying questions
3. Handle common objections
4. Identify good-fit vs. bad-fit prospects

Think: "Informed beginner" not "subject matter expert."

  - Quotes from buyer (useful for social proof)

**Template:** `../templates/01-research-brief-template.md`

**🤖 AI Prompt:**
```

2. Specific pain points mentioned
3. Why they chose this solution vs. alternatives
4. Quantifiable results
5. Key quotes useful for prospecting
6. Which ICP segment this represents

```
