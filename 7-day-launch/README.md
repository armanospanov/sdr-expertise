## ⏱️ Timeline Overview

| Day | Focus | Time | Output |
|-----|-------|------|--------|
| **Pre-Day 1** | Requirements Gathering | 2-3 hrs | Completed vendor intake form |
| **Day 1-2** | Research & Intelligence | 8-12 hrs | Product knowledge + objection bank |
| **Day 3** | List Architecture | 6-8 hrs | 600 segmented prospects |
| **Day 4** | Messaging Creation | 6-8 hrs | 24 emails + 6 call scripts |
| **Day 5** | Tech Stack Setup | 4-6 hrs | CRM + sequences configured |
| **Day 6** | Dry Run & Calibration | 4-6 hrs | Tested messages + Week 1 plan |
| **Day 7** | Launch | Full day | 100 emails + 80 calls sent |

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

### By Day 7, you should have:
- ✅ 600 qualified prospects loaded in CRM
- ✅ 6 segment-specific email sequences
- ✅ 6 segment-specific call scripts
- ✅ Configured tech stack with tracking
- ✅ 100+ emails sent
- ✅ 80+ calls made
- ✅ 8-15 conversations completed
- ✅ 1-3 meetings booked (or pipeline building for Week 2)

### By Week 4, you should have:
- 📈 Clear data on best-performing segments
- 📈 Optimized messaging based on real responses
- 📈 Repeatable playbook for this ICP
- 📈 4-8 meetings booked
- 📈 2-4 opportunities created

## 🔑 Critical Success Factors

1. **Don't skip research** - You can't write compelling emails without understanding pain points
2. **Segment properly** - Generic lists = generic messaging = bad results
3. **Quality > quantity** - 100 targeted emails beat 500 spray-and-pray
4. **Measure everything** - What gets measured gets improved
5. **Iterate weekly** - Your Week 4 messaging should be sharper than Week 1
6. **Use AI strategically** - Leverage LLM prompts for research and first drafts, but always personalize

## 📊 Key Metrics to Track

**Daily:**
- Emails sent
- Calls made
- Conversations (>2 min)
- Meetings booked
- Reply rate

**Weekly:**
- Meeting conversion rate (replies → meetings)
- Show rate (booked → attended)
- Opportunity conversion rate (meetings → opps)
- Best performing segment

**Monthly:**
- Full funnel: Prospects → Conversations → Meetings → Opps → Closed
- Cost per meeting
- Pipeline generated

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone this system
```bash
cp -r 7-day-launch my-vendor-name-launch
cd my-vendor-name-launch
```

### Step 2: Fill out vendor intake form
Open `templates/00-vendor-intake-form.md` and complete all sections.

### Step 3: Follow Day 0 guide
Start with `daily-guides/day-0-requirements.md`

### Step 4: Execute day by day
Follow each daily guide sequentially. Don't skip days.

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Timebox everything** - Each day has time estimates. Stick to them.
- **Use the LLM prompts** - They'll save you hours on research and first drafts
- **Customize, don't copy** - Templates are starting points, not final outputs
- **Test before launch** - Day 6 dry run is critical. Always test messaging.
- **Review daily** - Spend 30 min at end of each day reviewing what worked
