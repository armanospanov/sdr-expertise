## Pro Tips

**Don't memorize scripts.** Memorize frameworks and key points. You want to sound natural, not robotic.

**Use the 90-second rule.** Most answers should be 60-90 seconds. Longer = rambling.

**Bridge answers together.** When you answer "Tell me about yourself," preview your answers to "Why sales?" and "Why this company?" to take control of the interview.

**Always end with engagement.** Finish strong answers with: "Curious to hear your feedback on that" or "Does that align with what you're looking for?"
