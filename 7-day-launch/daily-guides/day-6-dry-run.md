## 🗣️ Day 6 Reflection Questions

Before Day 7, ask yourself:

1. **Am I confident in my messaging?**
   - If no, what needs to change?

2. **Do I know my product well enough?**
   - Can I handle basic questions?

3. **Are my systems ready?**
   - Would they work if I got 50 replies tomorrow?

4. **Is my mindset right?**
   - Am I approaching this with curiosity vs. fear?

5. **What's my backup plan?**
   - If tech fails, how do I pivot?

**Remember:** Day 7 won't be perfect. That's okay. The goal is to START, not to be flawless. You'll iterate and improve every day.

**You've got this. Launch tomorrow with confidence. 🚀**
