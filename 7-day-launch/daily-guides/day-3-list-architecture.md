# Day 3: List Architecture

> **Time Required:** 6-8 hours  
> **Goal:** Build 600 segmented, qualified prospects ready for ABAB cadence

## 🎯 Overview

This is where most SDRs fail. They build one giant, unsegmented list and blast generic messages. You're going to build **segment-specific lists** that enable **persona and industry-tailored messaging**.

Segmentation = personalization = higher response rates.

## 🧩 The Segmentation Strategy

### Core Principle: 2x2 or 2x3 Matrix

Create 4-6 distinct segments by combining:
- **2-3 Personas** (titles/roles)
- **2-3 Industries** (or company types)

**Example Matrix:**

|  | SaaS | FinTech | Healthcare |
|---|------|---------|------------|
| **VP Sales** | List 1 | List 2 | List 3 |
| **CRO** | List 4 | List 5 | List 6 |

**Result:** 6 distinct segments, each gets tailored messaging.

### Alternative Segmentation Approaches:

**By Company Stage:**
- Seed/Series A
- Series B/C
- Growth/Late stage

**By Geography:**
- East Coast
- West Coast
- International

**By Use Case:**
- Problem A solvers
- Problem B solvers
- Problem C solvers

**By Tech Stack:**
- Salesforce users
- HubSpot users
- Pipedrive users

## ✅ Day 3 Checklist

### Morning (2-3 hours): Define Segments

#### 1. Choose Your Segmentation Variables
- [ ] Decide on 2-3 personas to target
- [ ] Decide on 2-3 industries or company types
- [ ] Create your segment matrix (2x2 or 2x3)
- [ ] Name each segment clearly

**Example Segment Names:**
- "VP Sales - SaaS"
- "VP Sales - FinTech"
- "CRO - SaaS"
- "CRO - FinTech"

#### 2. Define List Criteria for Each Segment

For EACH segment, document:

**Use Template:** `../templates/02-list-criteria-template.md`

- Job titles (exact titles and variations)
- Seniority level
- Department
- Company criteria:
  - Industry keywords
  - Employee count range
  - Revenue range (if available)
  - Geography
  - Tech stack (if relevant)
  - Funding stage (if relevant)

**Example:**
```
Segment: VP Sales - B2B SaaS

Job Titles:
- VP of Sales
- VP Sales
- Vice President of Sales
- Vice President, Sales
- SVP of Sales

Seniority: VP level
Department: Sales

Company Criteria:
- Industry: Software, SaaS, B2B Software
- Employees: 100-1,000
- Revenue: $10M-$100M
- Geography: United States
- Tech Stack: Salesforce OR HubSpot
- Funding: Series A, Series B, Series C
```

### Afternoon (4-5 hours): Build and Verify Lists

#### 3. Build Lists in Prospecting Tool

**Tool Options:**
- Apollo.io
- ZoomInfo
- Sales Navigator
- Lusha
- Seamless.ai

**For Each Segment:**
- [ ] Input search criteria
- [ ] Apply all filters
- [ ] Aim for 100-150 contacts per segment
- [ ] Export to CSV

**🤖 AI Prompt for List Criteria Refinement:**
```
I'm building a prospect list for [SEGMENT NAME].

Current criteria:
- Job titles: [LIST]
- Company size: [RANGE]
- Industry: [TYPE]
- Geography: [LOCATION]

Help me:
1. Identify job title variations I might be missing
2. Suggest industry keywords that might capture this segment
3. Recommend any filters I should add or remove
4. Highlight potential issues with my criteria

Goal is to build a list of 100-150 high-quality prospects.
```

#### 4. Quality Check Each List

**Sampling Method:**
- [ ] Review 10 random profiles from each list
- [ ] Check:
  - Does the person match your persona?
  - Is the company a good fit?
  - Do they likely have the problem you solve?
  - Is contact data available (email/phone)?

**Red Flags:**
- Too many irrelevant companies
- Job titles not aligned to persona
- Companies outside your ICP size/industry
- Missing contact information

**If quality < 80% match rate: Refine your criteria and rebuild**

#### 5. Verify Contact Data

**Email Verification:**
- [ ] Use tool's built-in verification (if available)
- [ ] Or use: Hunter.io, NeverBounce, ZeroBounce
- [ ] Remove unverified/risky emails

**Phone Verification:**
- [ ] Check for direct dial vs. main line
- [ ] Prioritize mobile numbers if available
- [ ] Flag invalid/incomplete numbers

**Target: 70%+ verified contact data**

#### 6. Load Lists into CRM

- [ ] Create dedicated list views in CRM
- [ ] Tag each contact with segment name
- [ ] Add custom fields:
  - `Segment` (dropdown)
  - `List Date` (date added)
  - `Cadence Status` (not started/in progress/completed)
  - `Last Touch Date`
- [ ] Assign ownership (to yourself)

**Naming Convention:**
```
List: [Segment Name] - [Date]
Example: "VP Sales SaaS - Oct 2025"
```

## 📊 Deliverables

By end of Day 3, you should have:
- [ ] **6 segment definitions** (documented criteria)
- [ ] **600 total prospects** (100 per segment)
- [ ] **Contact data verified** (70%+ verified emails)
- [ ] **Lists loaded in CRM** (tagged and organized)
- [ ] **Segment strategy doc** (your 2x2 or 2x3 matrix)

## 📋 List Architecture Template

**Use:** `../templates/06-segment-strategy-template.md`

### Example Output:

```
## Segment Matrix

|  | SaaS | FinTech |
|---|------|----------|
| **VP Sales** | List 1 (125 contacts) | List 2 (115 contacts) |
| **CRO** | List 3 (110 contacts) | List 4 (130 contacts) |

**Total: 480 contacts across 4 segments**

## Segment Criteria Details

### Segment 1: VP Sales - SaaS
- **Titles:** VP of Sales, VP Sales, SVP Sales
- **Companies:** 100-1,000 employees, $10M-$100M revenue
- **Industry:** B2B SaaS, Software
- **Geography:** United States
- **List Size:** 125 contacts
- **Verification Rate:** 78%

[Repeat for each segment]
```

## 🧪 Self-Test: Are You Ready?

You're ready for Day 4 when you can:
- [ ] Show 6 distinct segments with clear criteria
- [ ] Demonstrate 100+ contacts per segment
- [ ] Verify 70%+ email verification rate
- [ ] Explain why you segmented this way
- [ ] Load at least one list view in CRM successfully

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

1. **Too broad segmentation** - "All sales leaders" is not a segment
2. **Too narrow criteria** - Can't build 100-person lists
3. **Ignoring data quality** - Garbage in = garbage out
4. **Not verifying contacts** - Bounced emails kill deliverability
5. **Building lists without a plan** - Segment first, build second
6. **Over-segmenting** - 10+ segments is too complex for Week 1

## 👥 ABAB Cadence Planning

With 6 segments, here's how you'll run ABAB in Week 1:

**Monday:**
- Email: Segment 1 (VP Sales - SaaS)
- Call: Segment 2 (VP Sales - FinTech)

**Tuesday:**
- Email: Segment 2 (VP Sales - FinTech)
- Call: Segment 1 (VP Sales - SaaS)

**Wednesday:**
- Email: Segment 3 (CRO - SaaS)
- Call: Segment 4 (CRO - FinTech)

**Thursday:**
- Email: Segment 4 (CRO - FinTech)
- Call: Segment 3 (CRO - SaaS)

**Friday:**
- Follow-up emails to all segments
- Follow-up calls to top priority responses

## 💡 Pro Tips

### List Building Hacks:

1. **Use Boolean search in Sales Nav:**
```
("VP of Sales" OR "VP Sales" OR "Vice President of Sales") 
AND (software OR SaaS OR "B2B software")
```

2. **Layer in tech stack filters:**
- Companies using Salesforce = likely have sales ops
- Companies using marketing automation = sophisticated buyer

3. **Use employee growth as a signal:**
- Fast-growing companies (20%+ headcount growth) often need your solution

4. **Check LinkedIn activity:**
- Prospects who post regularly are more likely to engage

5. **Prioritize recent job changes:**
- New VPs (< 90 days in role) often want to make an impact
