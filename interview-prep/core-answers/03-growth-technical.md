[DRAFT YOUR ANSWER HERE]

"Feedback is important because it's the quickest way to learn and improve. Coming into an SDR role, I know there's a lot I'll need to learn, and I can't figure it all out on my own through trial and error.

The fastest way to ramp is to learn from people like you, my AEs, and senior SDRs who've done this before and know what works.

The way I like to receive feedback is: I like to come with a plan first. I don't just expect you to tell me what to do. I'll put in the upfront work - whether it's my territory plan, messaging, account strategy - and bring that to you.

Then I want your feedback on that plan so I can course correct. I'll apply it, execute, and report back the next week. It's a cycle: plan, feedback, execute, report, repeat.

I know that's a big part of your job as a manager, and it's exactly what I'm looking for in a coach. I'm someone who takes feedback and actually applies it."
```

**Key Points:**
- [ ] Feedback = fastest path to improvement
- [ ] You're proactive (come with a plan)
- [ ] You create a feedback loop (not one-time)
- [ ] You understand the manager's role is coaching

## Q12: Where Do You See Yourself in 1-2 Years? (or 3-5 Years)

### What They're Really Asking
- Are you committed to growth here?
- Are you just testing the waters?
- Are your goals aligned with the SDR→AE path?
- Are you ambitious but realistic?

### Your Answer Framework

**Structure:**
1. Show long-term thinking
2. SDR role goals (master the fundamentals)
3. AE promotion timeline
4. Long-term vision (enterprise AE / management)
5. Emphasize immediate focus

### YOUR ANSWER:

```
[DRAFT YOUR ANSWER HERE]

"I'm thinking about this from a 3-5 year perspective. My goal is to come in and master the SDR role first - the fundamentals of the front end of the sales cycle:
- Territory planning and management
- Prospecting and pipeline generation
- Working closely with AEs and internal teams
- Understanding the product and buyer personas

Once I've mastered those skills - probably 12-18 months - my goal is to promote to Account Executive. That's where I want to learn full-cycle closing and run my own deals.

Long-term, I'm really interested in [enterprise AE roles / sales management]. I've always liked coaching and helping others improve. But I'm not getting ahead of myself.

My immediate focus is on becoming a top-performing SDR. I need to earn that AE promotion first by mastering the fundamentals and being someone the team can rely on."
```

**Career Path to Articulate:**
- **Year 1:** Master SDR role, top performer
- **Year 2:** Promote to AE, learn full-cycle sales
- **Year 3-5:** Enterprise AE or Management track

**Avoid These Mistakes:**
- ❌ "I just want to see if sales is for me"
- ❌ "I'm exploring different roles in the company"
- ❌ "I want to be a manager in 6 months"
- ✅ Show commitment to the sales track

## Q13: How Would You Manage and Organize a Territory?

### What They're Really Asking
- How do you think?
- Do you ask the right questions?
- Do you have a plan or just wing it?
- Are you proactive and organized?

### Your Answer Framework

**Structure:**
1. Ask clarifying questions
2. Identify low-hanging fruit first
3. Work with AE to prioritize strategic accounts
4. Build prospecting infrastructure ("coil the spring")
5. Execute systematically

### YOUR ANSWER:

```
[DRAFT YOUR ANSWER HERE]

"First, I'd want to understand the territory. Can I ask - what does the territory look like? How many accounts? Are these existing customers or net new? Any inbound leads?"

[Wait for their response or say:]

"Assuming it's a mix, here's how I'd approach it:

**Step 1: Low-Hanging Fruit**
I'd look in the CRM for past opportunities, stalled deals, warm leads - anything I can quickly activate.

**Step 2: Strategic Accounts with AE**
I'd meet with my AE weekly to identify our top target accounts. Which companies are our best-fit ICPs? Where should we focus?

**Step 3: Build Prospecting Infrastructure**
I'd 'coil the spring' by doing heavy lifting upfront:
- Identify top ICPs (job titles, departments, industries, buying triggers)
- Build segmented lists
- Create email templates and call scripts for each persona
- Set up LinkedIn messaging sequences

**Step 4: Execute Daily**
With all that prep done, I can focus on execution - hitting my activity metrics without having to think about what to do next.

That's my initial thinking. Curious to hear how you'd recommend approaching it?"
```

**Key Points:**
- [ ] Ask clarifying questions (shows strategic thinking)
- [ ] Prioritize (low-hanging fruit → strategic accounts)
- [ ] Preparation-focused ("coil the spring")
- [ ] Collaborative (work with AE)
- [ ] Invite their feedback

3. Show you won't overthink it
4. Connect to volume goals

### YOUR ANSWER:

```
[DRAFT YOUR ANSWER HERE]

"I know you can never be fully prepared for a cold call. My goal is to leverage the information at my fingertips but avoid analysis paralysis.

Here's my process:

**1. CRM Check**
Pull up any past interactions, notes, or context in the CRM.

**2. LinkedIn Review**
Check their LinkedIn for:
- Recent posts or activity
- Job responsibilities
- Career history (recent role changes?)

**3. Persona/Pain Point Alignment**
Understand what persona I'm calling:
- Are they in sales, marketing, ops, engineering?
- What pain points does [Product] solve for them?
- What buying triggers might be relevant?

**4. Flexible Framework**
Go in with a hypothesis, but be ready to adapt based on how the call goes.

I know the goal is 50 dials a day. To hit that, I can't spend 10 minutes researching every call. So I batch my research, build my lists in advance, and focus on execution during calling blocks."
```

**Key Points:**
- [ ] Research process (CRM → LinkedIn → Persona)
- [ ] Balance prep with execution
- [ ] Tie to volume goals (50 dials/day)
- [ ] Show flexibility (adapt during the call)

## Q15: How Would You Structure Your Day to Hit Activity Goals?

### What They're Really Asking
- Are you disciplined and structured?
- Can you manage time without handholding?
- Do you treat sales like a system or wing it?

1. Time blocking
2. Align with peak prospecting hours
3. High-leverage tasks first (while energy is high)
4. Protect time from busy work
5. Give a real-world example

### YOUR ANSWER:

```
[DRAFT YOUR ANSWER HERE]

"I'm a big believer in time blocking and treating sales like a system. Here's how I'd structure my day:

**Morning Block (8-9 AM): Prep**
- Review my list for the day
- Prioritize top accounts
- Prep call scripts / email messaging

**Peak Calling Hours (9-11 AM, 4-5 PM):**
- These are when prospects are most likely to answer
- I'd block these for pure prospecting - calls and emails
- Goal: Hit 50 dials and 25 emails

**Midday (11 AM - 4 PM):**
- Follow-ups
- LinkedIn outreach
- CRM updates
- AE sync meetings
- Research for next day's list

**End of Day (5-6 PM):**
- Wrap up any missed activities
- Review what worked / what didn't
- Prep tomorrow's list

**Protect My Time:**
I'd color-code my calendar so prospecting time is non-negotiable. I won't let busy work or internal meetings eat into my calling blocks.

I do this now in [school/work] where I have a lot competing for my time. Time blocking keeps me focused on high-leverage activities."
```

**Key Points:**
- [ ] Time blocking system
- [ ] Peak hours optimization
- [ ] High-leverage tasks first
- [ ] Protect prospecting time
- [ ] Give real example (school/work)

## Pro Tips

**Show your process.** These questions test your thinking, not perfect answers. Walk them through your logic.

**Ask clarifying questions.** Especially on Q13 (territory management). It shows strategic thinking.

**Use buzzwords naturally.** "Coil the spring," "time blocking," "peak hours," "low-hanging fruit" - these signal you know the game.

**Always invite feedback.** End with: "That's my initial thinking - curious to hear your take" or "Does that align with how your top SDRs approach it?"

**Connect to your current life.** If you time block now for school/work, say it. It makes your answer credible.
